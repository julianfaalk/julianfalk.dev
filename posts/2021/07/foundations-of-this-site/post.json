No frameworks, no build steps just markup, styles, and a single SQLite file for persistence.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping it minimal let me iterate quickly. If I wanted a guestbook, I wrote one. If I needed a counter, I added it. The stack stayed understandable and portable.</p>\n\n<p>Those foundations still hold: simple code, small files, and zero dependencies on heavy services.</p>"

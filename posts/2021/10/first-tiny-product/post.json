The goal was to practice charging money, not building a platform.</p>\n\n<p>Payment flow used Stripe Checkout, state lived in SQLite, and emails were plain text. Users appreciated the focus; I appreciated learning the full loop in days instead of months.</p>\n\n<p>That win set the tone for future releases: small, paid, and shippable.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I just created this blog on my own. Well actually, I used the LLM of choice (Opus 4.5) to create it and only guided it on the major things. Before doing this, I always read interesting posts from people posting on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HackerNews</a> about a certain topic. Always loved these little mini sites of people writing their opinionated thoughts on certain topics. So here we are, I don't know if anyone will ever read this but here we go.</p>\n\n<h2>The stack</h2>\n\n<p>If there is one thing I love above all in the software world, it is simplicity. But that simplicity is not, absolutely not, guaranteed at all anymore in today's time. How often do we think how awesome it would be to be using the fanciest tech-framework out there. Today the next nextjs/react/vue/angular/younameit-framework is right around the corner and wants you to use it. Well, not everyone might be thinking like that but that is an issue I am having often times. You see some fancy animation, some cool UI feature, some random framework does show or proposes you to use. You are almost hooked by it and start using the framework. So I thought: There should be a way of creating software sites without all the hustle and extra nerve-wracking idioticity.</p>\n\n<p>So this blog (yes, the article you are reading right now) is consisting of the simplest tech out there. The frontend is HTML with basic CSS. We use jQuery for JavaScript integration combined with PHP. Our database is a very-very-very lightweight SQLite database. And light means not even more than 100KB in size lol.</p>\n\n<p>And that is it already. The site was created by me in a few minutes by prompting and fine tuning and is now running on my VPS at almost no cost. Feel free to give some feedback or subscribe to new posts. I'll remind you via email if a new post on my blog has been made.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>"

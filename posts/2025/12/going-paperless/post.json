  "content": "<p>I hate paper. There, I said it. Every letter, every invoice, every random receipt piling up on my desk—it's been driving me nuts for years. So I did what any reasonable engineer would do: I built something to make it disappear.</p>\n\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n\n<p>Here's the thing about paper in 2025: it's still everywhere. Despite living in the digital age, my mailbox keeps filling up with stuff that needs to be \"kept for your records.\" Insurance documents, tax papers, contracts—you name it. And once you have it, what do you do? Stuff it in a folder? Lose it in a drawer? Hope you'll find it when you actually need it three years from now?</p>\n\n<p>I tried the classic approach: a filing cabinet with labeled folders. Lasted about two months before it became a black hole where documents went to die. The real kicker was when I needed an old rental contract and spent an hour digging through stacks of unsorted paper. Never again.</p>\n\n<h2>The Solution: Digitize</h2>\n\n<p>So I built <strong>Digitize</strong>—a simple web app that turns my phone into a document scanner. The workflow is dead simple: snap photos of each page, hit save, and it spits out a searchable PDF. That's it. No fancy features, no bloat, just the one thing I actually needed.</p>\n\n<p>The magic happens with OCR (optical character recognition). Every document gets processed so the text becomes searchable. Looking for that electricity bill from March? Just search for \"Stromrechnung\" and there it is. No more digging through folders.</p>\n\n<h2>The Stack</h2>\n\n<p>Keeping it simple was the goal. The whole thing runs in a single Docker container:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PHP + Nginx</strong> for the web interface</li>\n<li><strong>Python + ocrmypdf</strong> for the PDF magic</li>\n<li><strong>Tesseract</strong> for OCR with German and English support</li>\n<li><strong>Samba</strong> for accessing files directly from iOS Files app</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last one was a game-changer. With SMB sharing enabled, all my scanned documents show up right in the iOS Files app. No need to open a browser—just browse my documents like any other folder on my phone.</p>\n\n<h2>The Workflow</h2>\n\n<p>Here's what happens when a letter arrives now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Digitize on my phone</li>\n<li>Snap photos of each page</li>\n<li>Give it a descriptive name</li>\n<li>Hit save</li>\n<li>Throw the paper away (or shred it if it's sensitive)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The whole process takes maybe 30 seconds per document. Files get organized automatically by date, so I end up with a nice folder structure like <code>2025/12/29/invoice-internet.pdf</code>. No manual sorting required.</p>\n\n<p>My girlfriend Melissa has her own login too, with separate folders. We also have a shared folder for household stuff—utility bills, rental agreements, things we both might need access to.</p>\n\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n\n<p>The real win isn't the app itself—it's what it enabled. My desk is actually clear now. I have one small tray for incoming mail that gets processed within a day or two. Everything else lives in the cloud, backed up, searchable, and accessible from anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Tax season used to be a nightmare of hunting down receipts and statements. Last time, I just searched for what I needed and had everything ready in under an hour. That alone made the whole project worth it.</p>\n\n<p>There's also something satisfying about the ritual. Letter arrives, gets scanned, gets shredded. It's like a little inbox zero moment, but for physical mail.</p>\n\n<h2>Self-Hosting FTW</h2>\n\n<p>Could I have used one of the many existing document scanning apps? Sure. But here's why I didn't:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: My documents stay on my server, not someone else's cloud</li>\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: I can tweak it exactly how I want</li>\n<li><strong>No subscriptions</strong>: One-time setup, runs forever</li>\n<li><strong>Learning</strong>: Building it taught me a bunch about OCR and PDF processing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus, it's just more fun to use something you built yourself. Every time I scan a document, there's a tiny bit of satisfaction knowing the whole pipeline is mine.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Going paperless isn't about having zero paper—that's impossible as long as companies keep sending physical mail. It's about having a system that makes paper temporary. It arrives, gets processed, and disappears. The information stays; the clutter goes.</p>\n\n<p>If you're drowning in documents, I'd highly recommend building something similar. Or just use one of the existing solutions—the important thing is having any system at all. But if you're the type who enjoys building your own tools, there's something deeply satisfying about solving your own annoyances with code.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have a stack of Christmas cards to scan.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>",

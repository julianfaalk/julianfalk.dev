It&#039;s mostly been a whirlwind of my time in Vietnam, mixed with some random thoughts on tech, crypto, and life hacks. I&#039;ve compiled all my tweets into this one big blog post, written from my perspective like a personal diary of the chaos and charm. If you&#039;ve been following me @julianfaalk, this might feel familiar, but I&#039;ve woven it all together for a smoother read. Let&#039;s dive in!</p>\n\n<p>November: Gearing Up and First Impressions in Vietnam<br />\nThis year started off for me in mid-November with a bunch of tech gripes and excitement building for my big trip. Man, what the heck was going on with tech back then? In just one week, we had multiple cloud outages, X DMs totally broken, and every nerd on the platform hyping new AI like it was the second coming. I was venting about how everything felt buggy spam-filled emails, outdated calendars and joking that engineers must&#039;ve been &quot;vibe coding&quot; their way through it. I even called out AI-generated content as straight-up weird, but hey, I did share a tip on making ChatGPT faster and more efficient. Nice upgrade there!</p>\n\n<p>On the Apple front, I was baffled by Siri inconsistencies: If my iPhone was set to English, I&#039;d get the new Apple Intelligence Siri, but switch to German and boom back to the old version. Come on, Apple, why? I also got into some aviation safety chats and announced that the &quot;Vietnam blogging spray&quot; was about to begin the next day.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto popped up too I advised folks to hold off on buying Bitcoin, predicting the bottom in early to mid-2027 based on those halving cycles. Oh, and I couldn&#039;t resist praising Krispy Kreme donuts while questioning if AI tools like Nano Banana Pro were making images less valuable. Declining fast, I guess?</p>\n\n<p>As I prepped for Asia, I started nerding out on the different scripts: Korean&#039;s round-ish characters like 안녕, Japanese&#039;s curvy ones, Chinese&#039;s square-like symbols like 中国, Thai&#039;s elephant-loopy letters like สวัสดี, and Vietnam&#039;s readable but overloaded ones like Cảm ơn. Tourism stats surprised me Malaysia ranking high, Cambodia overtaking the Philippines and I pushed back on stereotypes, insisting Vietnam isn&#039;t unsafe or crime-ridden at all. From my early visits, the people were some of the hardest-working and friendliest I&#039;d ever met.</p>\n\n<p>Food was an instant highlight: That Vietnamese coffee? On another level super strong (you&#039;ll get the shakes, haha), but so good. They&#039;re the second-biggest coffee exporters in the world! I tried egg coffee and loved how affordable it was $2 including delivery.</p>\n\n<p>What struck me most about Vietnamese folks was their approach to work-life balance or lack thereof, compared to us Westerners. I met people grinding 7 days a week, 12-hour shifts for weeks on end, only taking off if demand dropped. It&#039;s that customer-driven mindset, I think. And the mini-businesses everywhere! It felt like shops outnumbered citizens; everyone runs a little spot, trading directly with each other since big corps aren&#039;t as dominant.</p>\n\n<p>Practical stuff from the trip: All those VPN apps? Useless for what they&#039;re marketed for they just never work. Airport pet peeves: Why do people stand up the second the plane lands? We&#039;ll meet at baggage claim anyway! I swore by suitcases over backpacks and lived on those $1 taxi rides. I asked about safety in Da Nang/Hoi An (totally worth it, by the way) and debated skipping straight to the south.</p>\n\n<p>December: Deep in the Hanoi Hustle and Island Vibes<br />\nBy December, I was fully immersed in Vietnam, starting in Hanoi. After the first few hours, I was already loving the vibe #1 city for me. I posted pics of the bustling streets and rooftops, calling it the &quot;city of vibes.&quot; The traffic madness was real; I shared videos of the absolute chaos and reminded everyone complaining about Western commutes to chill it&#039;s nothing compared to this! To the Vietnamese people: HOW do you live like this? Shop-lined streets everywhere, pure energy.</p>\n\n<p>Scams were a lesson learned the hard way. In a thread, I detailed getting ripped off by a fake Grab taxi near train street: The driver quoted the app price, then locked the doors and demanded 350k Dong. Total scam TLDR: Stick to the original Grab app, folks!</p>\n\n<p>On lodging, hotels crushed Airbnbs here. Our Hanoi Airbnb didn&#039;t match the pics chalky walls, sink issues but hotels? 10/10 with the friendliest staff ever. They&#039;d even pick up your phone and put a towel under it while you eat. That level of kindness!</p>\n\n<p>Food became my daily obsession: Pics of &quot;the daily treat in Vietnam,&quot; more treats, and me declaring I&#039;d never want other food again. Noodles, soups, beach vibes we were still there, soaking it up. Convenience was king; booking day tours via a quick WhatsApp chat was a dream.</p>\n\n<p>I explored Minh Binh countryside on day three, with mountain pics and videos. Then Phú Quốc Island blew my mind it&#039;s basically under Russian control now, full of them with signs in Russian because flights from Russian cities boomed as Thailand got pricier.</p>\n\n<p>Random observations: Vietnamese attaching exit signs to their own meters (better safe than sorry, I guess?). People just live with that grind. Without mobile data, your phone&#039;s a useless brick realized that quick. I switched back to the X iOS app after Safari mobile got worse. Satirized EU fines: &quot;I hope he&#039;ll follow the rules now more precisely!!1!&quot; And work ethic: It&#039;s just how they roll.</p>\n\n<p>Tech, Business, and Random Ramblings Throughout<br />\nMixed in with the travel were my usual side tangents. On indie hacking: The real challenge is getting feedback when you have zero following and you&#039;re building a product. AI replies on X or LinkedIn? Please stop it&#039;s weird. Short, direct, human is better.</p>\n\n<p>I geeked out on ChatGPT&#039;s new efficient mode: &quot;Didn&#039;t know this was possible now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Monitors: Still hunting for the best anti-glare one (shoutout to @grok). Flights: Why no better options than Google Flights or Skyscanner? Creatine tip: Doesn&#039;t mix well with hot liquids (though that might be debunked). SEO gripe: &quot;Why don’t you show the product?&quot; In Turkey, BTC Turk ads everywhere at Istanbul airport people flocking to crypto with 32% inflation, crazy.</p>\n\n<p>X features: Why no Wrapped-style year recap like Spotify? (Holy, that&#039;s a lot of music time.) Romantic vibes: &quot;A banger is a banger 4 eva.&quot; And pure gratitude: Visiting a tropical spot in winter is a blessing. Hoi An&#039;s old town is beautiful, especially those tropical island feels.</p>\n\n<p>EU satire again: &quot;Wtf&quot; at fines outpacing taxes. And development awe: &quot;Hoooooly, this image is from the same viewpoint??&quot; showing Da Nang&#039;s insane growth.</p>\n\n<p>Wrapping It Up: Lessons from a Year of Exploration<br />\nLooking back, 2025 on X was all about my Vietnam immersion the entrepreneurial spirit, killer cuisine, scam warnings, and tech complaints. It&#039;s been a year of gratitude for the simple things, humor in the chaos, and resilience everywhere I looked. Ending on a high note with that efficient ChatGPT tweak: &quot;You can now make ChatGPT fast &amp; efficient. Nice!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If you&#039;re planning a trip, hit me up in the comments. Thanks for reading stay tuned for more adventures in 2026!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,<br />\nJulian Faalk<br />\n@julianfaalk</p>"

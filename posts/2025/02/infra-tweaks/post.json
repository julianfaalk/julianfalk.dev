This covers design choices, constraints, trade-offs, and the small experiments that make the big picture hang together. Infra diary   Process: how the system is hosted, how I deploy, how I back up, and how I monitor whether things still run when I am asleep. Lots of pragmatic notes for future me.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Momentum: a set of habits that keep me shipping. Routines for planning, writing, and measuring progress without getting stuck in perfecting the tooling.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Story: context on why I picked this stack, how it fits into the rest of my projects, and what I am optimizing for when time is scarce.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Tactics: the tiny, repeatable moves that accumulate into progress. Checklists, scripts, and templates that reduce friction so I can focus on the next experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Reflection: what went well, what I would redo, and the next iteration I am lining up. Honest notes about surprises, risks, and mitigations.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Delivery: decisions about scope, quality bars, and when to call something done. Balancing the urge to keep polishing with the need to ship and learn.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Impact: how changes affect users, my own workflow, and the operational load. Making sure every tweak earns its keep and is easy to revert if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Cadence: how often I publish, how I manage drafts, and how I keep the content useful for future readers who discover it out of order.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Practical notes: links to tools, commands I re-run, and the numbers that tell me whether the experiment worked. Less fluff, more utility.</p>\n\n<p>Infra diary   Ship log: what I changed, what I learned, and what I broke along the way.

Lots of pragmatic notes for future me.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Momentum: a set of habits that keep me shipping. Routines for planning, writing, and measuring progress without getting stuck in perfecting the tooling.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Story: context on why I picked this stack, how it fits into the rest of my projects, and what I am optimizing for when time is scarce.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Tactics: the tiny, repeatable moves that accumulate into progress. Checklists, scripts, and templates that reduce friction so I can focus on the next experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Reflection: what went well, what I would redo, and the next iteration I am lining up. Honest notes about surprises, risks, and mitigations.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Delivery: decisions about scope, quality bars, and when to call something done. Balancing the urge to keep polishing with the need to ship and learn.</p>\n\n<p>Kickoff journal   Impact: how changes affect users, my own workflow, and the operational load.

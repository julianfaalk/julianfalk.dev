No charts to babysit, just the facts.</p>\n\n<p>This change reduced the urge to chase noise. When something important moves, it shows up in the text and I act. Otherwise, I keep building.</p>\n\n<p>Less screen time on dashboards freed hours each week for actual work, and the codebase is healthier because I am not optimizing for vanity metrics.</p>"

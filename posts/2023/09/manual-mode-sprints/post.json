It forced me to tighten scripts and make rollbacks trivial.</p>\n\n<p>The experiment exposed brittle spots places where I relied on automation to hide complexity. By fixing those, the automated path later became faster and safer.</p>\n\n<p>Manual mode also reminded me to document every step. That log is now the on-call runbook.</p>"

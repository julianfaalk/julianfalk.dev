Backups became file copies, migrations became schema checks, and deployments became simpler.</p>\n\n<p>Performance improved because reads are local and writes are predictable. I monitor the WAL size and vacuum occasionally to keep things tidy.</p>\n\n<p>This change also reduced costs: no managed DB, no networking egress surprises.</p>"

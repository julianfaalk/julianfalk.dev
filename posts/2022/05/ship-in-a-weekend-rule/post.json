That constraint forces scoping discipline what can a user see, click, and benefit from in two days?</p>\n\n<p>The rule killed perfectionism. I picked defaults instead of settings, wrote shorter copy, and reused components instead of inventing new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Most ideas fizzled quickly, which was the point. The few that survived became real features with proven demand.</p>"

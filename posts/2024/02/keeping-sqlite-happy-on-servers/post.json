Backups are just file copies with a short lock, then rsync to cold storage.</p>\n\n<p>I monitor for long-running queries with a tiny cron job that dumps `sqlite3` stats to a text file. Anything suspicious gets fixed before it becomes a problem.</p>\n\n<p>This approach keeps the stack small: no external DB to babysit, no migrations waiting for a window. Just a single file that moves with the code.</p>"

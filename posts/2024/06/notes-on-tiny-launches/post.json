    "content": "<p>Tiny launches are about momentum, not grandeur. I ship a page, a button, or a single integration and then tell ten people who might care. Feedback is immediate and specific because the scope is obvious.</p>\n\n<p>The discipline is to stop decorating. No extra animations, no dead-end settings, no unneeded copy. Just the minimum path to learn whether the idea resonates.</p>\n\n<p>After a few cycles, the surface area grows naturally, but only in response to actual use. That keeps the project lean and the hosting simple.</p>"
